# Notes-Template
This is a bit of a personal problem as well as a unique solution but Here I have done a personal Figma design process for developing LaTeX template for notes and other things that I usually like to do. Think of it as two projects 1) Designing(? better word needed) some sort of Document using Figma 2) Make LaTeX templates out of that process.
